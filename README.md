#Spring5-mongo-recipe-app

Recipe Application Using MongoDB.


I made the adjust necessaries to make the migration of the project spring5-mysql-recipe-app from MySQL Server to MongoDB and creating the project spring-mongo-recipe-app. I changed the Pojos, Structures in java files and so on, and I used gradle in this case. 

In this project I have created commands, domains, controllers, repositories, services and so on, to permit the interaction with MongoDB. In properties I put the information to configure the conexion. Also I created the project for testing.
